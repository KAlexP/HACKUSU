	All right, so here is a description of how the schematics are on the
esp32 board after much confusion and error.

Analog and digital pins are labeled differently even though they may be the
same pin. Here are now the analog pins are labeled:


If you look at the example program, you'll notice that the analog read pin
is set to A0. When you are using an analog pin, you have to define it as A
following some number. If you look at the schematic picture, you can see 
where those A pins are.


Here is how the digital pins are labeled:

With the normal digital pins, however, they are just the same as the GPIO 
numbers in the schematic, which are also the same as the D number on the 
physical board. So in the example program, it uses the GPIO pin 13, which
is the D13 pin on the actual board (near the microUSB next to the vin and
gnd)

PINS THAT YOU HAVE NOT PROGRAMED FOR MAY STILL PRODUCE OUTPUTS

I tried finding the correct pin by trying to find which one was 
outputting when I programmed for that. If you don't specifically program 
for a pin, it can produce an output, so be careful about that.
