	So I didn't make this program, I just copied it from someone who 
got it to work, however, I did look at it a little bit, it seems like
there is a class called accelgyro and there are some different fundtions
you are able to call within the class.

	accelgyro.initialize()

		initializes the gyrosensor

	accelgyro.getMotion6(6 16-bit integer parameters)

		gets you the motion that it can output 
		(acceleration x, y and z, and the x, y and z angles)

If this confuses you, just look at the code, it is pretty self
explainatory. Luckily though, it seems pretty easy!!!
